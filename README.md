Homework 2

Build a web application that shows a list of posts and information about the post's author. This will require the following steps:

API endpoint: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

[x]1. Make an API call to retrieve all of the posts.
[x]2. Make an API call to retrieve all of the users.
[]3. Display the author's name and the post title and body on the page. ** Note: the userId in the Post details matches the id in the user detials

Grading criteria:
[x]1. Use fetch, 
  [x]async, and
  [x] await.
  
[]2. Use the find() method. (to ID the author?) https://www.javascripttutorial.net/es6/javascript-array-find/

[]3. Use only ES6+ techniques if needed: template strings (`${}`), arrow functions, forEach(), etc.

4. Use GitHub and make at least 5 commits with meaningful commit messages in the present tense. For example: "Create filter function."
5. Do not have any extraneous comments beyond explanations of code (if needed) in your final result. Do not have any console.logs, in comments or otherwise.
6. CSS is not necessary and will not be graded but is encouraged for the sake of practice.

Stretch goal:
[] When a user clicks on a post, make an API call to retrieve the comments associated with that post and display them on the page.
